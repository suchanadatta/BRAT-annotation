Almost three years after an earthquake devastated Haiti, 370,000 people are still living in the tent camps that became their homes. Now, some have lost even that. Haitian officials say that 18,000 families living in tent camps have been rendered homeless by Hurricane Sandy, which has killed 52 there since making landfall last week. The number of casualties may continue rising, as aid workers have found 86 new cases of cholera just in the earthquake survivor camps of capital city Port-au-Prince. A cholera outbreak that began after the quake has killed an estimated 7,400 since October 2010. In the video above, desperate camp survivors describe life after Sandy. "No one has brought anything to help us," one man says. "It is though no one knows we exist." "We are hungry, things for me are bad, our tarp is torn," a woman tells the camera. "It's misery." A young woman says she no longer has a place to sleep as her bed has been soaked. Because no one appears to have built drainage into the camp, the tents are filled with standing water. "I couldn't sleep last night and I really wept," she says, describing a night of attempting to bail water out of her tent. "After Tropical Storm Isaac in August, these stocks have not been replenished," an aid worker warned Reuters when asked about diminishing food and water supplies. "What we're doing is scraping the bottom."
