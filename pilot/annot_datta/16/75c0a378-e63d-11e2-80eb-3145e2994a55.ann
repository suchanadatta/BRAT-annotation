T1	The United Nations sent Nepalese peacekeeping troops to bring relief to Haiti after it was devastated by a 7.0-magnitude earthquake in 2010. A study published last week in mBio, the journal of the American Society for Microbiology, concludes that the peacekeepers also brought cholera, triggering an epidemic that has sickened hundreds of thousands of Haitians and killed more than 8,000. After sequencing the DNA of 23 samples of the cholera-causing bacterium from Haiti and comparing them to the DNA of strains found elsewhere, researchers said the outbreak could be traced to Nepal, where the disease is endemic. They also concluded that the outbreak in Haiti came from a single source, undermining the hypothesis that the disease was repeatedly introduced to the country over the past three years
